### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was just another reminder of my HTML and CSS ways of displaying content and doing it with tailwindcss thereby making my code reuseable. And also the simplier use of Javascript.

### Continued development

I plan on doing one other FrontEndMentor challenge specifically one involving .json files to further my knowledge of async-await, classes and promises in javascript. Then I start learning React.
